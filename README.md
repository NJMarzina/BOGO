**Welcome to BOGO**

My name is Nathan Marzina and I am a recent graduate from Temple University w/ by B.S in Information Science.
During my tenure at Temple I got really familiar with C#. But, I have always had an itch for game development, but never knew where to start.

With that being said, this is my first project using love2d's game engine, with uses the language Lua.
The idea of the project is simple, to create an application that is the epitome of the only app you'd wanna have during a plane ride..
An application that has all the best brain teasers, card games, and basic stimulation, without requiring an internet connection.

To begin this journey, I watched tutorials and have built the basic game Pong. Here is the idea of a roadmap.

0. Pong (we are here) (6-14-2025)
1. Coin - flips heads for 25 cents
2. DoC - Solitaire
3. Poker against AI.. 80% royal flush for AI..
   pair =$1, trips +$3, straight w/8 =$8...
  - Eventually have to BEAT royal flush
  - 5oKind - once you play 5, ai plays
  - 6 o kind.. you get trolled and lose.
4. Chess board -- $150
5. Sudoku
6. Minesweeper
7. Flappy bird
8. Doodle jump
9. Basketball
10. Flow/snake
11. Blackjack/Roulette/craps/yahtzee/candyland

The list goes on and on. these games are just ideas currently, with an overall story of playing as a character and leveling up, thus unlocking games.

The name BOGO comes from BOGO sort, with the idea that one day you will have to use bogo sort or something to solve something. also have like bogo in shops frequently idk
